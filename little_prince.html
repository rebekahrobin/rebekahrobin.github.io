As the little prince dropped off to sleep, I took him in my arms and set out walking once more. <span class = "lineunder">
I felt deeply moved, and stirred. It seemed to me that I was carrying a very fragile treasure. </span>

<span class = "highlighting">
It seemed to me, even, that there was nothing more fragile on all Earth. 
</span>

In the moonlight I looked at his pale forehead, his closed eyes, his locks of hair that trembled in the wind, and I said to myself: 

<span class="boldred"> "What I see here is nothing but a shell. What is most important is invisible..."</span>

As his lips opened slightly with the suspicion of a half-smile, I said to myself, again: 

<span class = "boldred"> "What moves me so deeply, about this little prince who is sleeping here, is his loyalty to a flower--the image of a rose that shines through his whole being like the flame of a lamp, even when he is asleep . . ." </span>

And I felt him to be more fragile still. 

<span class = "lineunder"> I felt the need of protecting him. as if he himself were a flame that might be extinguished by a little puff of wind. . .</span>
